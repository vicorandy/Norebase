#  Bonus Challenge: Improvements for Resilience and Scalability

## Abuse Prevention:
- Implement rate limiting, allowing a user to like an article only once within a certain timeframe.
- Use a Redis cache to track the userâ€™s actions and limit based on IP or session ID.

## Handling High Traffic
- Caching: Use a Redis cache for storing the like count of popular articles. Frequently requested counts can be cached and updated every few seconds, minimizing database load.
- Load Balancing: Distribute requests across multiple servers to handle high concurrency.
- Implement sharding to split data across multiple servers, making the data accessible faster.
- Use a message queue (like Kafka or RabbitMQ) to queue like updates and process them in batches, reducing simultaneous database writes.

## Scaling for Millions of Concurrent Requests
- Like Requests: For scalability with concurrent like requests, use a message queue and a batch update approach to group multiple likes into a single database write.
- Read Requests: To handle high-volume like count requests, implement caching and load balancing across read replicas in the database.
